<?php
/*
 * This php is responsible to check the login user's credentials. It deos the following important jobs :
 * 1) It verifies the login user's credentials - username and password. If true, is sets the active bit = 1
 * 2) It prevents muliple logins from the same user within one session or across tabs and browsers.
 * 3) Once the user succesfully logs in, it also sets its active bit = 1 in all its friend's local table
 * 	  so that, when they come online, they see this friend as online.
 * 
 *  This php is called from the login.php when the user submits its login credentials. If the log in credentials 
 *  are faulty, the gives the user a prompt of invalid entry. Also, if the user tries multiple logins, this php
 *  logs out the user from the existing session and returns him to the login page.
 *  
 *  Once logged in, the user is taken to its profile page which will show the list of all of his online friends.
